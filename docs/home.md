Welcome to Simple Asset Manager's Documentation and User Guides.  Our goal is to provide our User's with the most pleasant experience possible while using our platform.  

The Documentation is divided into the main User types, Asset Managers and Tenants.  However, documentation and guides are accessible to all if you are curious about what's on the other side of the fence.

If there is anything you feel is unclear or could be improved, please let us know at support@simpleassetmanager.com.
