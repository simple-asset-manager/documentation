Welcome to Simple Asset Manager's Documentation and User Guides.  Our goal is to provide every user with the most pleasant experience possible while using our platform.  

The Guides walk you through common scenarios, such as adding a property or accepting online payments, and include sample data you may use for training.  If this is your first time using Simple Asset Manager, we recommend you begin here.

The Documentation is divided into the three main types of user, Asset Managers, Tenants, and Investors (coming soon), describing the capabilities and features of each in greater detail.  While they are separately presented here, all three of these sections work in harmony behind the scenes to give you a much greater level of detail than traditional software has offered.  

Documentation and guides are accessible to all if you are curious about what's on the other side of the fence.

If there is anything you feel is unclear or could be improved, please let us know at support@simpleassetmanager.com.
