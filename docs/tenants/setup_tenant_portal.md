Setting up a Tenant Portal requires your Property Manager to send an Invitation to your e-mail address.

Once you have received the Tenant Invitation in your e-mail, register for an account **with that e-mail address**.  The Invitation Code will only work for the e-mail address it issued to.

When setting up your new account, be sure to select "Tenant" from the options after verifying your e-mail address.

After finalizing your account information, enter the Tenant Invitation code that was included in the e-mail.

:::note
The Tenant Invitation code will look like **b37cd4db-499a-4a94-91c5-0b88450e41c7**
