*Syncing* is a simple process that requires only an e-mail address.

- Navigate to the **Tenants** tab and click on "Edit Tenants."
- Select the Tenant to be synced from the dropdown.
- Choose *Sync* from the sidebar and enter the e-mail address to send the Invitation.

:::note
The Tenant Invitation (and Invite Code) will only work for the e-mail address provided.  Please ensure that the Tenant Invitation is sent to the e-mail address that the tenant will use to register with Simple Asset Manager.
:::

Once an Invitation is sent, the Tenant creates an account with Simple Asset Manager and enters the *Invite Code* to sync with the Property.
